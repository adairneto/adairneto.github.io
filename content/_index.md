# Welcome to my web page! 

I'm an undergraduate Mathematics student at [IMECC - Unicamp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/).

My main interest is Stochastic Analysis, particularly Malliavin Calculus and applications to Finance. 

My curriculum is available [here](https://github.com/adairneto/CV/blob/main/CV.pdf).
