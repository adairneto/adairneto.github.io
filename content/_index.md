# Welcome to my web page! 

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Melbourne's School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at [IMECC - Unicamp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/).

My main research interest is in the interplay between Probability and Geometry. I'm also interested in Rough Path theory and Malliavin Calculus. If you're interested, you can find an introduction to Malliavin Calculus [here](https://github.com/adairneto/Malliavin-Calculus/blob/main/seminario.pdf). 

For more details about my background, check out my CV [here](https://github.com/adairneto/CV/blob/main/CV.pdf).
