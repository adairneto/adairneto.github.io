# Welcome to my web page! 

I'm an undergraduate Mathematics student at [IMECC - Unicamp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/).

My main interest is Stochastic Analysis, particularly [Malliavin Calculus](https://github.com/adairneto/Malliavin-Calculus) and [Stochastic Differential Equations](https://github.com/adairneto/Stochastic-Differential-Equations/). An introduction to Malliavin Calculus is available [here](https://github.com/adairneto/Malliavin-Calculus/blob/main/seminario.pdf). 

My curriculum is available [here](https://github.com/adairneto/CV/blob/main/CV.pdf).
