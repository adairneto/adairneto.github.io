# Welcome to my web page! 

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Melbourne's School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at [IMECC - Unicamp](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/).

My research focuses on Stochastic Analysis, with a particular interest in Rough Path theory and Malliavin Calculus. If you're interested, you can find an introduction to Malliavin Calculus [here](https://github.com/adairneto/Malliavin-Calculus/blob/main/seminario.pdf). 

For more details about my background, you can check out my [here](https://github.com/adairneto/CV/blob/main/CV.pdf).
